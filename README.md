# Deep Learning Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my Deep Learning Projects Portfolio repository!

This repository is a personal collection of experiments, prototypes, and explorations in the field of deep learning. It includes implementations using popular frameworks like **PyTorch** and **TensorFlow**, and covers a wide range of topics such as:

- Neural network architectures
- Training techniques and optimizations
- Computer vision tasks
- Natural language processing
- Reinforcement learning
- Transfer learning
- Model evaluation and visualization

## üìÅ Structure

Some of the experiments are created using Google Colab and organized by topic or project.

- **Shazam**: Shazam like Song Identifier using PyTorch and Qdrant Vector-Database (and using FMA-Small Song Dataset).
- **movie-genre-prediction**: an experiment with Logic Tensor Networks for Multi-Label Classification of movie-genres using PyTorch and ltntorch package.
- **facial-emotion-recognition**: an experiment with Vision Transformers to classify facial emotions in FER2013 face images dataset.
- **complex-valued-facial-emotion-recognition**: a project implements a facial emotion recognition (FER) system using complex-valued neural networks.
- **invoice-ocr**: simple code snippet showing how easy it is doing turkish-OCR using Baidu's PaddleOCR.
